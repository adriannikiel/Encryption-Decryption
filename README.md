Privacy is an important matter is the realm of the Internet. When sending a message, you want to be sure that no-one but the addressee with the key can read it. The entirety of the modern Web is encrypted - take https for example! Don’t stay behind: hop on the encryption/decryption train and learn the essential basics while implementing this simple project.
### Learning outcomes
Gradually get familiar with Java, paying special attention to working with files and the command line.
### This project is a part of the following tracks
"Java for Beginners" "Java Desktop Application Developer" "Java Backend Developer" "Java Core" "Java Developer"
### What you’ll do and what you’ll learn
- Stage 1/6 Encrypted:
Learn to input the data and encrypt it, replacing the letters.
- Stage 2/6 Knowledge is the key:
Learn to encrypt messages with a numeric key, using the Caesar cypher.
- Stage 3/6 Decrypted:
Encrypting a message is only half of the deal: now learn to decrypt it as well, using a standard Unicode table
- Stage 4/6 I command you:
Practice working with the command line, using it for passing the mode, the key and the string.
- Stage 5/6 X-files:
Work with files: learn to store your data in a file.
- Stage 6/6 Choices, choices:
Add the possibility to choose a specific encryption algorithm: Ceasar or Unicode.
